# Use this file to make a minimal subset of the OpenLayers code, designed to be included in CycleStreets.
# http://docs.openlayers.org/library/deploying.html
# The files in here were initially generated by doing an rgrep "new OpenLayers" *.js  - then filtering by unique class name.
# Make a thorough job of looking for all the classes that get used, both from .js and javascript within .php files.
