# Script to deploy CycleStreets backup on Ubuntu
# Tested on 12.10 (View Ubuntu version using 'lsb_release -a')
# This script is idempotent - it can be safely re-run without destroying existing data

echo "#	CycleStreets backup deployment $(date)"

# Ensure this script is run as root
if [ "$(id -u)" != "0" ]; then

### CREDENTIALS ###

# Get the script directory see: http://stackoverflow.com/a/246128/180733
# The second single line solution from that page is probably good enough as it is unlikely that this script itself will be symlinked.
DIR="$( cd -P "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"

# Use this to remove the ../
ScriptHome=$(readlink -f "${DIR}/..")

# Name of the credentials file
configFile=${ScriptHome}/.config.sh

# Generate your own credentials file by copying from .config.sh.template
if [ ! -x ${configFile} ]; then
    echo "#	The config file, ${configFile}, does not exist or is not excutable - copy your own based on the ${configFile}.template file." 1>&2
    exit 1
fi

# Load the credentials
. ${configFile}

# Main body of script

# Fallback runs on a smaller server than the main one, with these main features:
# - Website appearing as normal to users and API keyholders
# - Routing working
# - Routing area limited to core areas (UK + Ireland and custom areas)
# - Photomap present
# - No archived routes
# - Batch routing, infrastructure data, collisions, etc., can be omitted
# - Custom routing differences tolerable for a short period.

echo "#	Fallback deployment is not handled by a script."

# Confirm end of script
echo -e "#	All now deployed $(date)"

# End of file
