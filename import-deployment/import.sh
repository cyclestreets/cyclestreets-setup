# SYNOPSIS
#	import.sh [force]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	Main script for building new routing edition.
#	Optional force argument is used to overwrite existing routing edition - which is convenient during development testing.
#
# Run as the cyclestreets user (a check is peformed after the config file is loaded).

# Start an import run
echo "#	$(date) CycleStreets import"

# Ensure this script is NOT run as root
if [ "$(id -u)" = "0" ]; then
    echo "#	This script must not be be run as root." 1>&2

# Bomb out if something goes wrong

### CREDENTIALS ###
