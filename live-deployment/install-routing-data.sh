SYNOPSIS
	$0 -h -q -s -t -m email importHostname [edition] [path]

OPTIONS
	-h Show this message
	-m Take an email address as an argument - notifies this address if a full installation starts.
	-q Suppress helpful messages, error messages are still produced
	-s Skip the database dump file and suggest an alternative strategy for copying the database
	-t Does a dry run showing the resolved options

ARGUMENTS
	importHostname
		A hostname eg machinename.cyclestreets.net

	edition
		The optional second argument identifies the routing edition e.g. routing161012.
		If not specified, or given the value 'latest', the latest edition on the host will be found and used.
	path
		The optional third argument (a non slash terminated directory path) says where on the host the routing edition can be found.
		Defaults to the hardwired location: /websites/www/import/output

DESCRIPTION
 	Checks whether there's is a new edition of routing data on the importHostname.
	If so, it is downloaded to the local machine, checked and unpacked into the data/routing/ folder.
	The routing edition database is installed.
	If successful it prompts to use the switch-routing-edition.sh script to start using the new routing edition.

	Secure shell access is required to the importHostname which can be setup as follows:
# cyclestreets@machinename1:~$
ssh-keygen
# accept defaults ie: suggested file and no passphrase

# Copy to the importHostname eg:
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub machinename2.cyclestreets.net

### Alternative strategy for transfering database demonstrated for user: simon

## On source machine
# Shutdown mysql
# simon@${importHostname}:~$
sudo systemctl stop mysql

# Move the database folder and change owner
sudo mv /var/lib/mysql/${importEdition} ~/tmp/
sudo chown -R simon.simon ~/tmp/${importEdition}


## On target machine
# simon@target.cyclestreets.net:~$

# Copy from source (may take many hours)
# Use a low priority to allow other stuff to run smoothly
nice -n12 rsync -avz ${importHostname}:~/tmp/${importEdition} ~/tmp

# Move copy into datbase
sudo chown -R mysql.mysql ~/tmp/${importEdition}
sudo mv ~/tmp/${importEdition} /var/lib/mysql/

# May be necessary to restart mysql
sudo service mysql restart
sudo systemctl restart mysql

##	Load nearest point stored procedures
smysql ${importEdition} < /websites/www/content/documentation/schema/nearestPoint.sql

## Build the photo index
smysql ${importEdition} < /websites/www/content/documentation/schema/photosEnRoute.sql
smysql ${importEdition} -e "call indexPhotos(false,0);"

# Create a file that indicates the end of the script was reached - this can be tested for by the switching script
touch "${websitesContentFolder}/data/routing/${importEdition}/installationCompleted.txt"

## Clean up
## Back on source machine
# simon@${importHostname}:~$
# Put the database back
sudo chown -R mysql.mysql ~/tmp/${importEdition}
sudo mv ~/tmp/${importEdition} /var/lib/mysql/
sudo systemctl start mysql
