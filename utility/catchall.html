<h1>CycleStreets webserver</h1>
<p>You have reached the CycleStreets webserver machine. You probably meant to be at:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.cyclestreets.net/">CycleStreets</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Are you setting up a new site with us?</h2>

<p>Looks like you've <strong>correctly</strong> pointed your DNS to our system - thanks.</p>
<p>We'll be in touch shortly once we've added the configuration for your site, which will remove this page.</p>


<h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Are you using a very old browser?</h2>

<p>If the above links take you back to this page, it is very likely you are using a very old browser which doesn't support the support the HTTP 1.1 "host" field. Without this field, the webserver can't process the browser's request as it is unable to determine the address of the site you requested.</p>
<p>The most common browsers which support this are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/chrome/">Chrome</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a></li>
	<li><a href="www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/">Internet Explorer</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Without upgrading your browser, you are likely to have problems with a large number of other sites on the Internet, as we use the most common method of hosting our websites.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Other reasons</h2>

<p>If you are using a modern browser, please let us know by e-mail to webmaster<span>&#64;</span>cyclestreets.net.</p>
