# Main body of script

# Location of temp files
tempDir=${websitesContentFolder}/data/tempgenerated/

# This is a script to remove all the temporarily generated files.
# Note that shell wildcards should be avoided in these commands because there are too many files: use "find" instead.
#
# The following find command selects top-level files in the given paths that are older than 24 hours and deletes them.
# It works as follows:
# Folders of all the temp folders to clear out are given as paths.
# -maxdepth option stops find going into the .git folder relative to the paths.
# ! (which is escaped) negates the next test.
# -mtime 0 finds files modified within the last 24 hours
# -type f finds only files
# ! -name Skips files matching the given name
folders="elevationProfile maplet photomaplet tile"
for folder in ${folders}
do
    find ${tempDir}${folder} -maxdepth 1 \! -mtime 0 \! -name '.gitignore' -type f -delete
done

# Thumbnails
# It is not usually necessary to clear out the thumbnails, but rather than using a clever find it is simpler to:
# 1. Delete the thumbnail folders and contents
#	rm -rf thumbnails
#	rm -rf thumbnails2
# 2. Re-create the thumbnails folder, best done by git pull from the tempgenerated folder:
#	cyclestreets@www:${websitesContentFolder}/data/tempgenerated$ git pull
# 3. You may need to update ownership
#    cyclestreets@www:${websitesContentFolder}/data/tempgenerated$ sudo chown -R www-data thumbnails
#    cyclestreets@www:${websitesContentFolder}/data/tempgenerated$ sudo chown -R www-data thumbnails2


# End of file
